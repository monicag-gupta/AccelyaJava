  Create a New Branch for a Jira Issue
      Let's say your Jira issue key is PROJ-101

      git checkout -b feature/PROJ-101-login
  Commit with Smart Commit Message
      P1-2
        git commit -m "PROJ-101: Added login feature #comment login module done #time 2h #transition In Progress"

  This commit will:
        Link the commit to the Jira issue
  Add a comment to the issue
        Log 2 hours work
  Move the issue to "In Progress"
        Jira will automatically detect this if GitHub is integrated and Smart Commits are enabled.
