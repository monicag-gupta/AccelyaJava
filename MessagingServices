List Topics:
kafka-topics.sh --list --bootstrap-server <kafka_broker>
Send Messages:
kafka-console-producer.sh --topic <topic_name> --bootstrap-server <kafka_broker>

Dependencies: 
  Use spring-boot-starter-kafka for integrating Kafka with Spring Boot.
Configuration: 
  Configure Kafka properties in application.properties or 
  application.yml for producer and consumer settings.
KafkaTemplate: 
  Use KafkaTemplate for producing messages to Kafka topics.
@KafkaListener: 
  Use the @KafkaListener annotation to create a Kafka consumer 
  within your Spring Boot application.
Kafka Streams
Kafka Streams: 
  A library for building real-time applications and microservices 
  that process data stored in Kafka topics. 
  It provides a simple and powerful DSL (Domain-Specific Language) 
  for stream processing.
Kafka Connect
Kafka Connect: 
  A tool for integrating Kafka with external systems, 
  such as databases, key-value stores, and file systems. 
  It simplifies the process of moving data into and out of Kafka.
Monitoring and Management
JMX Metrics: 
  Kafka exposes metrics via JMX (Java Management Extensions), 
  which can be monitored using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
Kafka Manager: 
  A web-based tool for managing and monitoring Kafka clusters.





Zookeeper and Kafka broker

Zookeeper is a service required by Kafka to manage distributed brokers and maintain metadata. 
Kafka relies on Zookeeper for leader election and configuration management.

Example Configuration (zookeeper.properties):
dataDir=C:/kafka/zookeeper-data
clientPort=2181
dataDir: Directory where Zookeeper stores its data.
clientPort: Port on which Zookeeper listens for client connections.

Once Zookeeper is up and running, you can start the Kafka broker. 
The broker is the component that stores and manages data.
Example Configuration (server.properties):
broker.id=0
log.dirs=C:/kafka/kafka-logs
zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181
listeners=PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092
broker.id: Unique ID for the Kafka broker in the cluster.
log.dirs: Directory where Kafka stores its log files.
zookeeper.connect: Address of the Zookeeper instance.
listeners: Protocol and address on which Kafka listens for client connections.

Start Kafka

Zookeeper: Starts first and manages Kafkaâ€™s distributed coordination.
Kafka Broker: Starts after Zookeeper and manages message storage and retrieval.

Start terminal as sudo / powershell as administrator:
> cd C:\kafka 
> .\bin\windows\zookeeper-server-start.bat .\config\zookeeper.properties

Minimize it.

Start another terminal as sudo / powershell as administrator:
> cd C:\kafka 
> .\bin\windows\kafka-server-start.bat .\config\server.properties
Minimize it



.\bin\windows\zookeeper-server-start.bat: 
    This batch file starts the Zookeeper server on Windows.
.\config\zookeeper.properties: 
    This is the configuration file for Zookeeper, 
    specifying settings like data directory, client port, and more.

.\bin\windows\kafka-server-start.bat: 
    This batch file starts the Kafka server on Windows.
.\config\server.properties: 
    This is the configuration file for the Kafka broker

Verifying Kafka and Zookeeper : 
    To ensure that Kafka and Zookeeper are running correctly:
Zookeeper: 
    Check that the Zookeeper process is active and listening on the configured port (default: 2181).
Kafka: 
    Verify that the Kafka broker is active and listening on the configured port (default: 9092).
Troubleshooting : 
    If you encounter issues starting Kafka or Zookeeper:
        Check Logs: 
            Review the log files in C:\kafka\logs for error messages.
            Verify Configuration Files: Ensure that zookeeper.properties and server.properties have correct paths and settings.
            Port Conflicts: Ensure that ports 2181 (Zookeeper) and 9092 (Kafka) are not being used by other applications.
