Interface Iter -> 
next() -> navigates to next element
Iter() -> it points to the 1st element in the array
Hasnext() -> Check for End of Array

Int[5] arr
Add(int ele)
Remove(int ele) -> first occurring ele
Delete(int position/index) -> ele at index

Exceptions:
Add more than capacity
Next() without checking hasnext()
Delete from negative index
Remove ele not in arr

A comma separated list  containing pairs of topic name and time in hours 
( Java 14, JEE 64, JME 28) will be entered in the a string statement(input by the user) or 
command line argument. 
If a day consists of 8 hours, list out the topics that will be covered day-wise. 
Define all necessary exception for the program.

		Raise an exception
	If the input is not in pairs: Raise an exception : 
		input[].length is not even
	If hours are not given as numbers: Raise an exception
Example:	
	If Input is : 
		Java Fourteen, .. ;; 
		java 14, jee 56, mysql ;; 
		java 14; jee 46; mysql 45;
	Output: Sample Run:
	>java prog 
	INPUT: Java_AdvJava 73, JEE 104, MySQL 15, go 24
	OUTPUT:
	Java_AdvJava : 10 Days
	JEE : 13 Days
	MySQL : 2 Days
	React : 3 Days
