In the table demo, for the employee id taken from the user, 
if the salary the employee is getting is less than 10000, 
say: “Last_name is getting Salary not up to Industry standards” 
else say “Last_name is getting  Salary up to the Industry standards”



WA block in PLSQL to check if number of employees in the table emp3 
is more than 100 or not. If it is more than 100, then print in output 
“The company is working well” else print “The company is going through downfall now”




WA block where we insert into index-by-table all names of customer indexed by their id.
--All names should start with either A, C, J, L, D : Use like or pattern clause in 
the cursor query.
Display the result separately through another loop after insertion is over:
  Customer ID : 101 for name : Abc




Prepare a trigger for insert or update in employees table, 
so that: we cannot insert any employee with ID as a multiple of 
100 unless the manager id of these employees is 100. also, ids 
222 or 007 or 111 is not allowed at all

Also, prepare a  trigger for deletion of employees making it 
not possible for deleting any employee with id: 100, 101 or 102 
or any employees with manager id as 100.
